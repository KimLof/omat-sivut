# My Portfolio Website

## Description

This website serves as a project showcase and practice area for new skills I've acquired along the way. It was built using React, and the site's design was crafted with CSS. You can explore the site at [kimcode.fi](https://kimcode.fi/).

*Note: This is my old portfolio.*
